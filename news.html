                    <h3>Breath Of The Wild Delayed until 2033</h3>
                    <p>“We have decided to extend our development a bit and change the release to Spring 2023,” Aonuma said. 
                        “In order to make this game’s experience something special, 
                        the entire development team is working diligently on this game, so please wait a while longer.”</p><br>

                        Much of the information about Breath of the Wild 2 is still being kept secret, though, including its actual title — 
                        Nintendo still refers to the game as “The Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” 
                        With the game now set to release next year, though, there’s still plenty of time for Nintendo to reveal more about Link’s next big adventure.

                    <h3>PS5 updates improves performence for a console that no one have.</h3>
                    <p>Sony secretly added auto low latency mode support (ALLM) for compatible TVs in version 22.01-05.00.00, which automatically ensures your display is set to the optimal picture mode. However, you might have noticed that certain TV settings are now no longer available.</p>

                    <p>The majority of users might not even encounter any issues with ALLM, as it’s primarily designed to help those who aren’t comfortable with exploring their TV settings get the best experience possible while gaming. For more advanced users, though, ALLM in its current implementation on PS5 is rather restrictive, and the fact it can’t be turned off without resorting to rather drastic measures is disappointing.</p>

                    <h3>Jesus Christ Invading Elden Ring</h3>
                    <p>The messiah has made his way to Elden Ring, as a player called Jesus Christ keeps invading other people's games and peacefully performing gestures of worship.

                        As posted on Reddit, one Elden Ring player encountered the Christian savior in the game’s PvP mode, but what starts as an ominous showdown quickly transforms into a spontaneous moment of peaceful worship. 
                        
                        Both players walk slowly toward one another, stop toe to toe, and simultaneously perform the Rapture gesture, raising their hands in the air in what looks like recognition of the Lord. The whole encounter is supposedly entirely spontaneous, and remarkably in sync.</p>

                    <p>
                        “I entered this world an invader. I left this world a believer,” the original poster titled their video.

“Glad you didn't kill the guy. His game takes three days to load every time he dies. Must be horrible,” said another commenter, with a gag that’s surprisingly on-trend for the Easter season.

Another pointed out that Jesus looks to be carrying a few daggers on his hip, presumably just in case he crosses any non-believers while wandering the Lands Between.

                        Despite Elden Ring’s punishing difficulty and unrelenting challenge, the community that’s sprung up around FromSoftware’s latest action RPG is surprisingly playful. As well as sharing tactics for defeating tough bosses and showing off impressive combat runs, players have been quick to embrace the lighter side of the game.

One player shared a character build that turns their Tarnished into a Sith Lord. Another has come up with an inventive way of destroying rune-harvesting AFK grifters using a giant cannon. For others, Elden Ring simply gives them an opportunity to perform comical stunts by invading other people's games.

Jesus Christ isn’t the only real-life figure to make his way to Elden Ring. Players calling themselves Will Smith have started invading people's games, walking up to their opponents and slapping them across the face in an imitation of the actor’s recent Oscars appearance.
